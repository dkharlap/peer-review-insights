## What's the Deal with Peer Reviews? ##

You ever notice how code reviews are like airport security? You gotta go through them, they take time, but in the end, it's for everyone's safety. Writing code is one thing, but catching bugs? That’s a whole other ballgame. Security? A solid review process helps keep hackers from waltzing in like they own the place, and is a requirement for many security frameworks and security controls.

Let's make that whole process a little less of a mystery. This tool checks out your GitHub repo and tells you who's reviewing what, how long they're taking, and whether their comments actually lead to changes—or if they’re just saying, "Looks good to me!"

## Why Keep Tabs on It? ##
If nobody’s keeping track of reviews, it’s like leaving your fridge door open—sooner or later, things are gonna start smelling bad. By tracking review stats, you can see who's doing the work, who’s just phoning it in, and whether your team is actually improving or just running in circles:

- **Who’s Reviewing?** Find out who's actually leaving comments.
- **Who’s Making an Impact?** See which comments lead to code changes.
- **How Fast Are We Moving?** Measure review times, because nobody likes waiting.
- **Big Picture Trends!** Get the full scoop on how your team’s review habits evolve—or don’t.

## Open Source – Get in Here! ##

This thing is open source, which means anyone can jump in and contribute. You wanna add features? Go for it. Spot a bug? Fix it. Let’s make peer reviews a little less painful and a little more like a smooth comedy routine. 

Because, really, what’s the deal with bad code reviews?
